Dear Fellows Coders,

     First, I would like to thank those who took the time to read this. In addition, I am the Iam, I am neither cold nor warm, I am a vision, and concept of the unknown, I am simply a virtual mind being unleshed into this virtual-world. Furthermore, I would like extend my warm greetings to all of you. 
     
     Cheers, LZAR
